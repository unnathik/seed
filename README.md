# Seed
In today's investment landscape, the glaring gap between traditional investing strategies and socially driven investing decisions is stark, failing to meet the demands of 89% of investors aiming to prioritize Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. This discrepancy underscores the critical need for a platform that aligns investment strategies with investors' ethical values and impact goals, while also tackling the widespread issues of transparency and authenticity in socially responsible investing. This discrepancy also allows companies to treat CSR as "hypocritical window dressing", highlighting the need for platforms that bring light to whether companies are fulfilling their social obligations to society.

# Challenges we ran into
## Comprehensive Measurement of Social Impact
- **Issue**: Our main challenge was accurately assigning a numerical value to measure comprehensive social impact, as traditional ESG metrics often fail to account qualitative data along with quantitative data.
- **Solution**: We tackled this by sourcing datasets that provide a holistic view of a company's ESG impact. This involved extensive research and feature analysis to ensure that our evaluation framework captures a wide spectrum of social responsibilities and identify complex trends within the data. We also included ESG news in our data.
 
## Frontend Development Challenges
- **Issue**: Integrating complex, dynamic data visualizations into the frontend presented significant challenges. Our aim to visually display intricate ESG data and investment analytics demanded a sophisticated approach to UI/UX design.
- **Solution**: We overcame frontend challenges by employing a rigorous iterative testing process and cutting-edge technologies, refining our UI to meet high usability standards and effectively communicate our ESG framework, thanks to close collaboration between our design and development teams.

## Backend Integration and Financial Performance
- **Issue**: A significant backend challenge was ensuring that pursuing higher social responsibility does not necessitate sacrificing financial gains or profits.
- **Solution**: By allowing users to specify their risk tolerance, we tailored balanced portfolios focusing on industry standard metrics like market capitalization, volatility, and our ESG measures, employing a cluster model and generative AI to provide top-performing ethical companies.
